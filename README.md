## Image Classifier (Happy or Sad)

### Collect and Organize Data:
Gather a dataset of images containing happy and sad faces. You can use online datasets or create your own.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets. A common split is 80% for training and 20% for testing.

### Preprocess the Data:
Resize images to a consistent size, often a square to maintain the aspect ratio.
Normalize pixel values to a range between 0 and 1.
Augment the data by applying transformations like rotation, scaling, and flipping to increase the diversity of your training set.

### Build the CNN Model:
Import necessary libraries such as TensorFlow.
Define the architecture of your CNN. A simple model might consist of convolutional layers followed by pooling layers and dense (fully connected) layers.
Choose an appropriate activation function (e.g., ReLU) and output layer activation (e.g., softmax for binary classification).
Compile the model with a loss function (e.g., binary cross-entropy) and an optimizer (e.g., Adam).

### Train the Model:
Feed the training data into the model using the fit or train function.
Adjust hyperparameters like the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs based on performance.
Monitor training progress using metrics such as accuracy and loss.

### Evaluate the Model:
Use the test set to evaluate the model's performance.
Analyze metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Identify and address overfitting if necessary (e.g., by using dropout layers or reducing model complexity).

### Fine-Tune the Model:
If the model performance is not satisfactory, consider making adjustments to the architecture, hyperparameters, or data augmentation strategy.
Experiment with different architectures or use pre-trained models (transfer learning) for better performance.

### Make Predictions:
Use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.
Visualize the predictions and assess the model's performance.
